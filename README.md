Simple CPP learning project. Useless for other users.

# Lessons Plan
## Lesson 1: C++ Basics and Setup
### Learning Objectives:

Understand the basic structure of a C++ program.
Learn about headers, namespaces, I/O with cin and cout.
Create a basic "Hello World" program, focusing on C++ syntax.
### Assignment: 
- [x] Create a program that takes user input (your name and age) and prints a greeting. Use std::cin and std::cout correctly.

## Lesson 2: Variables, Data Types, and Operators
### Learning Objectives:

Learn about different variable types, including primitive types (int, float, char, bool).
Understand arithmetic and logical operators.
### Assignment:
- [x] Write a program that takes two integer inputs from the user and performs the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). Display the results in a readable format.

## Lesson 3: Control Flow and Functions
### Learning Objectives:

Practice if, else, and switch statements.
Learn to write simple functions, understand function prototypes.
### Assignment:
- [ ] Write a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Use functions to modularize the conversion logic.

## Lesson 4: Loops and Input Validation
### Learning Objectives:

Practice for, while, and do-while loops.
Understand input validation.
### Assignment: 
- [ ] Create a program that allows the user to keep guessing a randomly generated number (between 1 and 100) until they get it right. Provide hints ("higher" or "lower") after each guess. Ensure inputs are valid integers.

## Lesson 5: Arrays and Pointers
### Learning Objectives:

Learn about arrays and how they are stored in memory.
Understand the basics of pointers, pointer arithmetic, and memory addressing.
### Assignment: 
- [ ] Write a program that takes 10 numbers from the user, stores them in an array, and uses a pointer to find the average of these numbers.

## Lesson 6: Dynamic Memory Allocation
### Learning Objectives:

Learn about dynamic memory management with new and delete.
Understand the importance of avoiding memory leaks.
### Assignment:
- [ ] Write a program that dynamically allocates memory for an array based on user input (size of the array). Fill the array with random numbers and calculate the sum of the elements.

## Lesson 7: Strings and the Standard Library
### Learning Objectives:

Learn about C-style strings vs. std::string.
Understand the usage of common string operations.
### Assignment:
- [ ] Write a program that takes a string from the user and determines if it is a palindrome. Make use of std::string functions to simplify your implementation.

## Lesson 8: Object-Oriented Programming: Classes and Objects
### Learning Objectives:

Learn about defining classes, objects, constructors, and destructors.
Understand the basics of encapsulation.
### Assignment: 
- [ ] Implement a Car class with properties like brand, model, and year. Include constructors and member functions that display the car's details. Create and print details for a few car objects.

## Lesson 9: Inheritance and Polymorphism
### Learning Objectives:

Learn about inheritance, base, and derived classes.
Understand polymorphism with virtual functions.
### Assignment: 
- [ ] Create a base class Shape with a virtual function calculateArea(). Derive classes Circle and Rectangle that implement calculateArea(). Use these classes to calculate and display the areas of different shapes.

## Lesson 10: Operator Overloading and Friend Functions
### Learning Objectives:

Learn about operator overloading.
Understand the use of friend functions.
### Assignment: 
- [ ] Create a class ComplexNumber to represent complex numbers. Overload the + and - operators to add and subtract two complex numbers. Implement a friend function to display the complex number in the format "a + bi".

## Lesson 11: File Handling in C++
### Learning Objectives:

Learn to read and write to files using fstream.
Understand file input and output operations.
### Assignment: 
- [ ] Write a program that reads a text file containing student names and grades, calculates the average grade, and writes the result to another file. Ensure proper error handling.

## Lesson 12: Templates and the Standard Template Library (STL)
### Learning Objectives:

Learn about function and class templates.
Get familiar with the STL, focusing on vectors and maps.
### Assignment: 
- [ ] Write a templated function to find the maximum of an array of elements. Use std::vector to store different types of elements and find their maximum. Additionally, use std::map to store and print a collection of key-value pairs (e.g., country and capital).
